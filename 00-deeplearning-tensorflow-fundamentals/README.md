### ðŸ“– 00. TensorFlow Fundamentals Extra-curriculum 

* Read through the [list of TensorFlow Python APIs](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/), pick one we haven't gone through in this notebook, reverse engineer it (write out the documentation code for yourself) and figure out what it does.
* Try to create a series of tensor functions to calculate your most recent grocery bill (it's okay if you don't use the names of the items, just the price in numerical form).
  * How would you calculate your grocery bill for the month and for the year using tensors?
* Go through the [TensorFlow 2.x quick start for beginners](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/quickstart/beginner) tutorial (be sure to type out all of the code yourself, even if you don't understand it).
  * Are there any functions we used in here that match what's used in there? Which are the same? Which haven't you seen before?
* Watch the video ["What's a tensor?"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5liqUk0ZTw) - a great visual introduction to many of the concepts we've covered in this notebook.
