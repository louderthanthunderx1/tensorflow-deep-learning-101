### ðŸ“– 01. Neural network regression with TensorFlow Extra-curriculum

* [MIT introduction deep learning lecture 1](https://youtu.be/njKP3FqW3Sk) - gives a great overview of what's happening behind all of the code we're running.
* Reading: 1-hour of [Chapter 1 of Neural Networks and Deep Learning](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap1.html) by Michael Nielson - a great in-depth and hands-on example of the intuition behind neural networks.
* To practice your regression modelling with TensorFlow, I'd also encourage you to look through [Lion Bridge's collection of datasets](https://lionbridge.ai/datasets/) or [Kaggle's datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/data), find a regression dataset which sparks your interest and try to model.
