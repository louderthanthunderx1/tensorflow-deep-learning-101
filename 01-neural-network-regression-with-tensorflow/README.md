### ðŸ“– 02. Neural network classification with TensorFlow Extra-curriculum

* Watch 3Blue1Brown's neural networks video 2: [*Gradient descent, how neural networks learn*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHZwWFHWa-w). After you're done, write 100 words about what you've learned.
  * If you haven't already, watch video 1: [*But what is a Neural Network?*](https://youtu.be/aircAruvnKk). Note the activation function they talk about at the end.
* Watch [MIT's introduction to deep learning lecture 1](https://youtu.be/njKP3FqW3Sk) (if you haven't already) to get an idea of the concepts behind using linear and non-linear functions.
* Spend 1-hour reading [Michael Nielsen's Neural Networks and Deep Learning book](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/index.html).
* Read the [ML-Glossary documentation on activation functions](https://ml-cheatsheet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/activation_functions.html). Which one is your favourite?
  * After you've read the ML-Glossary, see which activation functions are available in TensorFlow by searching "tensorflow activation functions".
